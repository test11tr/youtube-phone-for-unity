Dear Developer,

Thank you for your support of OmniShade PBR.

To get started, I encourage you to check out the sample scene
as it'll quickly get you familiarized with the capabilities of the shader,
and hopefully give you some inspiration for your next project.

Here are also some handy links so you don't get lost:
